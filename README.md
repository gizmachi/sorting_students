# planetlab_tracer

A neat little program for handing out suitable assignments to new students. It's quite tailored to the application in mind, so someone who may want to use it can expect to have to do some modifications.  
The code may look a bit horrible, suggestions and improvements are welcome, but the project is not actively maintained. 

Happy hacking d^.^b
